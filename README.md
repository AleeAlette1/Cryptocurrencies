The purpose of this project was to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cyrptocurrencies and create a report including the traded cyrptocurrencies classifed by group according to their features. 

To complete this project, I used the following methods:
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA.
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA.
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means.
